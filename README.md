This project is an educational introduction to Kotlin, Gradle, Docker, and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

After developing multiple projects using Maven and Java, where testing was done manually, it’s time to enhance my DevOps knowledge by integrating these modern tools.

    Kotlin – To explore a new programming language.
    Gradle – As a build automation tool, transitioning from Maven.
    Docker – To simplify project deployment.
    TDD – To implement an extra verification layer and improve code reliability.
    
The idea is to start with a simple project that allows me to gradually introduce and familiarize myself with these tools.
